	abstract = {© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Changes in blood vessel formation, especially microvasculature formation, are one of the most important factors contributing to the poor wound healing capabilities of diabetic patients. Furthermore, recovery of the vascular network in the early stages after injury is a key factor in the prevention of wound expansion and ulcer formation. A hydrogel is a popular scaffold type and has many biological advantages, however, it is incapable of rapidly recruiting angiogenesis-related cells and cytokines to the wound area under the disturbed microcirculatory conditions of diabetics. For the above reasons, we devised a desferrioxamine (DFO)-loaded photo-crosslinked hydrogel (gelatin methacrylamide (Gelma)) for quickly developing the vascular network and accelerating skin reconstruction. The controlled release of DFO peaking at 16 h followed by a steady release after 48 h through the swelling of the Gelma hydrogel led to a significant increase of neovascularization. The in vitro results showed that DFO-Gelma provided an excellent microenvironment for cell viability, adhesion and proliferation, and up-regulated the expression of HIF-1α, which was critical for blood vessel formation. The in vivo studies showed new blood vessels, high quality granulation tissues, and early epithelialization in wound beds by treating them with DFO-loaded hydrogels. Through this investigation, the mechanism associated with wound healing was further investigated. This study demonstrated that DFO-Gelma was safe, reliable, and highly effective for the diabetic wound healing process.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The chemical nature of an implant is fundamental for successful bone regeneration. Recently, there have been much advancements in materials for bone tissue engineering, both natural and synthetic, that facilitate the repair and regeneration of bone tissues through the delivery of biomolecules and the support of cell growth. Among them, linear polymers have become the most commonly used class of materials for bone tissue engineering. A linear polymer is simply a macromolecular chain in which all structural units exist in a single line with no branches or intramolecular bridges. Most linear polymers have good processing properties and, depending on the molecular composition, may have different material characteristics, including wettability, degradability, and mechanical and biological properties. Linear polymers consist of natural polymers such as collagen, gelatin, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid, poly(lactic-. co-glycolic acid), polycaprolactone, and polyanhydrides. However, the development of bone implants that perform perfectly is still ongoing. This chapter will provide an overview of the major categories of linear polymers used in bone tissue engineering, how these biomaterials affect cell behavior, and their potential development in this area.},

	abstract = {The electrochemical reduction of CO2 has seen many record-setting advances in C2 productivity in recent years. However, the selectivity for ethanol, a globally signiﬁcant commodity chemical, is still low compared to the selectivity for products such as ethylene. Here we introduce diverse binding sites to a Cu catalyst, an approach that destabilizes the ethylene reaction intermediates and thereby promotes ethanol production. We develop a bimetallic Ag/Cu catalyst that implements the proposed design toward an improved ethanol catalyst. It achieves a record Faradaic eﬃciency of 41\% toward ethanol at 250 mA/cm2 and −0.67 V vs RHE, leading to a cathodic-side (half-cell) energy eﬃciency of 24.7\%. The new catalysts exhibit an in situ Raman spectrum, in the region associated with CO stretching, that is much broader than that of pure Cu controls, a ﬁnding we account for via the diversity of binding conﬁgurations. This physical picture, involving multisite binding, accounts for the enhanced ethanol production for bimetallic catalysts, and presents a framework to design multimetallic catalysts to control reaction paths in CO2 reductions toward desired products.},
