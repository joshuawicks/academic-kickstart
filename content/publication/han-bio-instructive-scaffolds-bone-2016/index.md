abstract: "Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The chemical nature of an implant is fundamental for successful bone regeneration. Recently, there have been much advancements in materials for bone tissue engineering, both natural and synthetic, that facilitate the repair and regeneration of bone tissues through the delivery of biomolecules and the support of cell growth. Among them, linear polymers have become the most commonly used class of materials for bone tissue engineering. A linear polymer is simply a macromolecular chain in which all structural units exist in a single line with no branches or intramolecular bridges. Most linear polymers have good processing properties and, depending on the molecular composition, may have different material characteristics, including wettability, degradability, and mechanical and biological properties. Linear polymers consist of natural polymers such as collagen, gelatin, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid, poly(lactic-. co-glycolic acid), polycaprolactone, and polyanhydrides. However, the development of bone implants that perform perfectly is still ongoing. This chapter will provide an overview of the major categories of linear polymers used in bone tissue engineering, how these biomaterials affect cell behavior, and their potential development in this area."
